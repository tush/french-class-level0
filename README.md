1. Think about breakfast ( when I wake up there is a smell of coffee )
2. …………..like a cat ( I don’t wake up in 5 seconds )
3. Look at my messages on my portable (  when I wake up in the morning it’s the 1st thing I do )
4. Take the time to bathe ( it’s not very ecologic but it repowers )
5. Put my favourite clothes on ( my children need 5 minutes to change but I like to take the time and put on my favourite clothes )
6. Take my breakfast ( I hate to start my day with out a good coffee / chai ) 🤣🤣
7. Brush teeth ( I love to brush my teeth before and after my breakfast )
8. Make up,hairstyle (we the girls we need make up.The beauty is important!you shave
9. Prepare for work ( I like to look in my bag to see if I have all my things ( my keys , my train ticket , my phone)  I hate to forget something )
10. Close the door and think that there is a good day ahead ( I drop my kids in school and I go to work I eat with my friend. I return home in the evening … and then finally go to sleep )
